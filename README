Info
====

This tool provides a generic way to access the data on the weatherstation
Conrad/ELV WS444. The concept was to write a tool which runs on an OpenWrt
enabled router with an USB port to just output the weatherstation status via a
webpage which is later fetched by another tool which puts the data into an RRD
or MySQL-Database.

Very helpful was the data stream analysis from another project by Jörg Köhler
from kisdndial.de which also reads the data from the WS444 and is able to
display it graphically and put it into a database.

If you want to format the output of this tool please see ws.c as an example on
how to handle the data.


Compile
=======

Simply: make

(At the moment there is no autoconf in planning, but if you want to do it,
please let me know so I can put it in the repository.)


Debug Messages
==============

Type: make WS_DEBUG=1


Demo Output
===========

If you use the standard JSON output, it will look like this:

{
  "version":         "0.01",
  "timestamp":       "1241429222",
  "version_station": "23",
  "wind_speed":      "7.7",
  "rain_sensor":     "58.7",
  "forecast":        "rain",
  "sensor":          {
    "0":               {
      "temperature":    "21.6",
      "humidity":       "45"
    },
    "9":               {
      "temperature":    "9.1",
      "humidity":       "64"
    }
  }
}


Credits
=======

The idea to this project was born by my teachers Sven Peter and Andreas
Petzoldt from the Industrieschule Chemnitz. They wanted to include a
weatherstation which is fixed on the roof of the school into the school
website. Special thanks to Sven Peter who provided us with the necessary
hardware, network access and a lot of support.

The other project members are:
  * Claudio-E. Himmer   -> collectd plugin, mysql storage and server administration
  * Michael Kühn        -> API to access data from RRD and MySQL via web
  * Michael Stummvoll   -> Java chart to visualize the data
